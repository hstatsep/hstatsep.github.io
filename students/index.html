                <h2>SEP vs CS</h2>
                <p>There is a lot of overlap between <strong>Software Engineering</strong> and <strong>Computer Science</strong>. Generally speaking, science focuses on understanding the world in the present, while engineering focuses on creating for the
                    future. Many of our graduates study Computer Science in college, and then become Software Engineers.</p>

        <div class="container-fluid" id="skills">
            <div class="container">
                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p>You will learn many tools and languages in SEP. But the point of this program is actually not to learn Github or Javascript, or even to be a programmer. The point of SEP is to equip you with a strong set of skills that will be useful anywhere.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: give/take within pair programming.</li>
                        <li><strong>Communication</strong>: articulating ideas to your partner, writing in your portfolio, public speaking in presentations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Problem decomposition</strong>: breaking a task down into smaller pieces.</li>
                        <li><strong>Logical reasoning</strong>: if P then Q, otherwise R.</li>
                        <li><strong>Debugging</strong>: reading errors, tinkering, talking through the problem (<a href="#rdd">RDD</a>).</li>
                        <li><strong>How to learn</strong>: technology changes fast. Some of the tools and languages you learn in SEP will probably become outdated. We often say <em>#loyo</em>, which means "Learn On Your Own."</li>
                        <li><strong>How to Google</strong>: what to search, how to filter, techniques like <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>.</li>
                        <li><strong>How to read</strong>: documentation and articles are very different from novels.</li>
                        <li><strong>Time management</strong>: prioritizing and scheduling tasks, working towards an <a href="#mvp">MVP</a>, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Growth mindset</strong>: patience, perseverance, and the courage to ask for help.</li>
                        <li><strong>Embracing failure</strong>: rather than being discouraged by a bug or an error message, we love mistakes because they help us learn.</li>
                        <li><strong>Organization</strong>: file management, hierarchy and relationships, whiteboarding your ideas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Attention to detail</strong>: spelling things correctly, adhering to syntax rules, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Consideration</strong>: we are building things that are meant to be used by other people. It is important to consider the impact of what we create.</li>
                        <li><strong>Creativity</strong>: how to think outside the box, be innovative, and create the future.</li>

                <h2>Honor Code</h2>
                <h3>Adapted from Edhesive, CS50, and freeCodeCamp</h3>
                <p>The HSTAT SEP Honor Code is a declaration by the entire community to strive for excellence in <strong>scholarship</strong> and in <strong>character</strong>. The Honor Code establishes <strong>trust</strong> among students, teachers, and staff that enriches collaboration. It deepens bonds between students and encourages a sense of personal <strong>responsibility</strong> that extends beyond the classroom.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This course’s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course’s material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.</li>
                    <li>The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on homework is limited to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your work to others, but you may not view theirs. Collaboration on quizzes is not permitted at all.</li>
                    <li>Below are rules of thumb that characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, ask your teacher.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3><strong>Reasonable</strong></h3>

                <h2>Slack</h2>
                <p>Starting in 10th grade, SEP students begin using Slack.</p>
                <p>Slack is an awesome communication tool used by many companies (we've seen it open on screens during every  field trip we've been on). It's basically a bunch of private customizable group chats (called “channels”), but with way more functionality (tags, search, code snippets, etc). It is very helpful for collaboration and debugging (and general announcements/chat), and much more efficient/streamlined than email. There is a mobile app (with plenty of customizable push-notification settings) as well as a desktop app (and it also works in the browser). It is a great communication tool for both student-to-student and student-to-teacher conversations. It is also a good experience for students because it could possibly be used during college/careers. Students are added to the following channels:</p>
                <p><strong>PUBLIC channels (open to EVERYONE in the HSTAT SEP group) for the following:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>General: </strong>announcements for Expos/Showcase, good articles to read, reminders, etc. Anything related to SEP. All 10th/11th/12-grade/graduate students & teachers are here.</li>
                    <li><strong>Random: </strong>non-SEP-related stuff: any sort of chat. Same group of people as above.</li>
                    <li><strong>Opportunities: </strong>since students are required to complete two opportunities prior to graduation, this is where students will get notified about new opportunities. Same group of people as above.</li>
                    <li><strong>webdesign: </strong>this is one of the topics in SEP10 (sub-topics include HTML, CSS, and Responsiveness).</li>
                    <li><strong>github: </strong>this is one of the topics in SEP10 (sub-topics include command line, git, and github).</li>
                    <li><strong>freedomproject: </strong>this is a topic that goes through all of SEP10. <strong>All</strong> students are in this channel, as the Freedom Project is implemented in every grade.</li>
                    <li><strong>MORE!</strong> (as students enter the 11th and 12th grade).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>A PRIVATE channel just for students in the same cohort/grade (and their teachers):</strong></p>
                <li><strong>20##: </strong>This cohort channel will be good for grade-specific questions <strong>unrelated to code</strong>. It will be mostly student-to-student conversations, but teacher(s) will have access to this channel so that they can jump in as they see fit (they can also use it as homework/project reminders and other announcements). This will also be a great way for students to keep in touch with each other after they graduate and keep connections to each other beyond emailing the few people they remember from high school.</li>
                <hr>
                <p>Students can also direct message their teacher (or anyone) on Slack with specific questions. But if you think someone else might have the same question, make sure to post it in the proper channel (that way they can see the answer)!</p>
                <p>Students are added to Slack via their HSTAT email address (for this reason, students should be checking their email!). <strong>Every student's username should be the same as their HSTAT email address</strong>, just without the “@hstat.org” (i.e. johnd1234). Slack can be used on smartphones and/or the computer.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For smartphones, there is a native app for iOS and Android devices.</li>
                    <li>For the computer, students have two options:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Install the native app by visiting <a href="https://slack.com/downloads/">slack.com/downloads</a></li>
                        <li>Use the web app by visiting <a href="https://hstatsep.slack.com/">hstatsep.slack.com</a> (this is a good link to memorize for scenarios where it is appropriate to use Slack during class).</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <h3><strong>Slack Tips</strong></h3>
                <p>Remember, there are dozens of people in each channel. If <em>Person A</em> has a question, they want everyone to get a notification (otherwise they might not see it). <em>Person B</em> might answer <em>Person A</em>’s question, and they may have a conversation back-and-forth about it. The benefits of posting in a channel (rather than directly messaging someone) is 1) to cast a wider net of people who can help you, and 2) that <em>Person C</em> might have the same question as <em>Person A</em> did. They can go back later and see all of the help that was given between <em>Person A</em> and <em>Person B</em>.  However, it would probably be annoying to everyone else in the channel if every single message triggered a notification. <strong>For that reason, there are specific alert triggers:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The default triggers for notifications are:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Direct messages (direct person-to-person messages)</li>
                        <li>Using <code>@channel</code> in a message</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>The default Do Not Disturb time is 10pm-8am.  People won’t get notifications during this time.</li>
                    <li>If you would like to change any of these defaults for yourself, you can change them in your app settings.  But you cannot change the default for others.  So if you’re posting a question that you want others to see, make sure you use <code>@channel</code> and you post between 8:01am-9:59pm</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As a recap, here is when you should/shouldn’t use <code>@channel</code>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>USE <code>@channel</code></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Asking a question</li>
                        <li>Reminding classmates about an assignment deadline</li>
                        <li>Posting an opportunity</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>DON'T USE <code>@channel</code></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Answering a question; instead use <code>@username</code></li>
                        <li>Random chat</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>If you have a smartphone, you’re going to want to install the Slack app on your phone. This is the best way to ensure you see the notifications.  But often times your reply requires being at a computer (typing a long message, needing to pull up your own program, etc). Refer to the links above for using Slack on a computer.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><strong>Which channel do I post in?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Question/comment about code → <strong>github</strong> or <strong>webdesign</strong> (depends on current topic)</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are upperclassmen in these channels who can answer your questions as well</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Question/comment/reminder about a due date, field trip, or something specific to 10th grade → <strong>20##</strong></li>
                    <li>Question/comment/announcement about hackathon, summer program, etc → <strong>opportunities</strong></li>
                    <li>Question/comment/joke/meme about non-SEP-related stuff → <strong>random</strong></li>

                <p><strong>How to respond</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Threads</strong> are a great way to keep conversations organized within a channel.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>On your phone: tap and hold the message to see 💬 <strong>Reply in Thread</strong></li>
                        <li>Everywhere else: hover over a message to see 💬 <strong>Reply in Thread</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Reaction emojis</strong> are a great way to give feedback, take polls, etc.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Type <code>:snaps:</code> to use our custom <img src="../img/snaps_emoji.png" style="height:40px"> emoji!</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Styling tips</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To make text appear bold: wrap it with asterisks: due *tomorrow* → due <strong>tomorrow</strong></li>
                    <li>To make text appear italicized: wrap it with underscores: leaving _right now_ → leaving <em>right now</em></li>
                    <li>To make text appear as code: wrap it with backticks (the key above tab) `function` → <code>function</code></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>^That^ only works for single lines of code; wrap multiple lines of code with <em>triple</em> backticks</li>
                        <li>Example:</li>
                        <pre style="font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif">

                <h2>MVP</h2>
                <p>Stands for <strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong></p>
                <p>Minimum = the least</p>
                <p>Product = what you make</p>
                <p>Viable = it works</p>
                <p>Essentially, it's <strong>the least you can make that works</strong>. Here's a diagram to help understand the concept.</p>

                <p class="text-danger">The top part of the image shows one way to build a car: work towards the end goal piece by piece, work on each piece until it is perfect, and then put the pieces together at the end. The problem with this approach is that the transportation device is completely unusable until the last step.</p>
                <p class="text-danger">Unfortunately, this is often what happens in students' projects. A student has a vision for their end product, and starts working on it piece by piece. For example, when working towards a website, a student will spend too much time working on the navigation bar until it is perfect. However, if they run out of time, they have a FANTASTIC looking navigation bar that it NOT functional because there is no more website for the buttons to link to.</p>
                <p class="text-success">The bottom part of the image shows a better approaching to building a car. If the goal of a car is to transport someone from Point A to Point B, consider the MVP: <strong>the least you can make that works</strong> -- in this case, a skateboard! Sometimes it takes longer than you would think to build a car, and so a skateboard isn't as flashy, but at least it gets the job done.</p>
                <p class="text-success">Similarly for students, the MVP approach is much more realistic when considering deadlines. Though you may dream of a "car," what is the "skateboard?" What is the least you can make that works? In the example of the student building a website, perhaps they spend less time making the navigation bar have the exact size/spacing/colors, and just get it to work -- meaning, also spending time on other parts of the website that the navigation bar can then lead to! Once a simple, functional website is built (like the skateboard), then they can add on to it (like adding a handlebar to a skateboard, making it a scooter) and work towards the "car" vision as time allows.</p>
                <p>A good practice is to set an "MVP" deadline before the final deadline. This is a good practice to take with you after high school, so that you are not procrastinating and trying to make a usable project/essay at the last minute. Instead, you are creating an MVP in advance of the due date, and then giving yourself time to make it perfect.</p>
                <p>The great thing about the MVP workflow is that it applies to any project, even outside of code: essays, applying to college, etc!</p>

                <h2>Stand-ups</h2>
                <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting" target="_blank">stand-up meeting</a> is usually conducted in workplaces each morning to ensure that a team is checking in regularly about their progress.</p>
                <p>As a part of HSTAT SEP, we will sometimes conduct stand-ups (either whole-class or small groups) to allow you to do the same. They usually consist of answering the following questions:</p>
                <ol><strong>
                    <li>What have you completed since the last stand-up? (or during this project)</li>
                    <li>What are you planning to work on next?</li>
                    <li>What, if any, problems are you facing</li>
                </strong></ol>
                <p>Doing stand-ups helps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure that you are managing your time efficiently</li>
                    <li>Let your peers know about your progress, especially if they can help you</li>
                    <li>Practice public speaking</li>

                <h2>Presentation Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Watch TED talks to get inspired.</li>
                    <li>Brainstorm, bullet point, draft, revise.</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice!</strong> Give your presentation out loud. In front of a mirror, to other people, and/or record yourself. The more you practice in these low-stakes environments, the more comfortable you will be in front of your peers. Make sure you time yourself!</li>
                    <li>Relax! You always feel more uncomfortable than you appear.</li>
                    <li>Don't stand right in front of the screen that the audience is looking at.</li>
                    <li>Don't point at the screen if the audience can't see it. Either point at the audience screen, or use the mouse to point.</li>
                    <li>Smile! Be enthusiastic! If you're excited about your presentation, the audience will be too!</li>
                    <li>Always end by saying "Thank you".</li>

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>A few basic principles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a minimal color scheme (2-3 colors). Black, white, and gray go with pretty much anything.</li>
                    <li>Keep your design simple. Often times less is more.</li>
                    <li>Make sure fonts are readable (not too small/curly) and consistent.</li>
                    <li>Make sure spacing/alignment is consistent.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Do we get honors credit for being in SEP?</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>11th and 12th-graders in SEP get honors credit (which gives your GPA an extra boost).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>What kind of laptop should I buy?</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It depends on your budget. If I had a one-stop recommendation, it would be a Macbook Air, and if a brand new one is too expensive, look for a used one. If you plan on using any resource-heavy applications for things like editing video/audio/images, consider getting a Macbook Pro. Or if you want higher specs (CPU/ram/storage) to make your computer more future-proof, that's another reason to get a Macbook Pro. But those are definitely more expensive. There are probably great Windows computers out there, but there is so much variety, especially when it comes to reliability.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Can I come out of SEP?</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a word, no. Very few students come out of SEP, and it is usually for extreme reasons. If you want to come out of SEP, the most likely reason is that you are lacking motivation; perhaps it is getting difficult and you struggle to see the benefit of the program. The best place to start is reading through the list of <a href="#skills">skills</a> attained by being in this program. Remember, even if you never write a line of code after this program, you can take ALL of those skills with you wherever you go!</li>
                        <li>If, after reflecting on the skills, you still want to come out of SEP, please talk to the following people <strong>in this order</strong>:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your teacher and grade advisor (both, but in any order)</li>
                            <li>Mr. Mueller, the SEP Coordinator</li>
                            <li>Ms. Shepard, the Principal</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>The most likely scenario is that, during one of those conversations, you will understand that staying in the program is the best course of action for you.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>What is the best IDE to use?</strong></li>
                    <p>That really depends on your situation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><u>For the work we do in HSTAT SEP</u>, you are likely doing your work on multiple computers that are shared with multiple people. In that case, <strong>a cloud-based IDE is ideal</strong>. We typically use a variation of cloud9. We used to use the classic cloud9, but as it was acquired by AWS, its pricing structure poses a problem for us. In the meantime, we are using <a href="http://ide.cs50.io" target="_blank">ide50</a>, an IDE based on Harvard's CS50 MOOC course. In the future, we might run our own server that hosts the cloud9 software. There are other cloud-based options out there, but none of them are as robust yet simple as cloud9.</li>
                        <li><u>For college work or any situation where you're always doing work on your own laptop</u>, <strong>a local IDE is ideal</strong>. A very popular solution is Visual Studio Code (VScode). You can also use editors like Sublime Text or Atom. On a Mac, Terminal or iTerm is used for a command line. And if preferred, you could install Github Desktop for a GUI interface.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Google Tasks and Google Calendar are great for time management. Google Tasks is ideal for your to-do list (i.e. homework, projects, etc), whereas Google Calendar is a great way to remember events in the future and also schedule your time. You can have multiple Tasks lists, and multiple Calendars.</li>
